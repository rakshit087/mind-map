_Programming_ is a way to instruct the computer to perform various task.

## Types of Programming Languages

There are various kind of programming languages, but they can be broadly classified into three types

### `Procedural Programming Languages`

A procedural language is a computer programming language that follows, in order, a set of commands.

Examples of computer procedural languages are BASIC, C, FORTRAN

Procedural languages are some of the common types of programming languages used by script and software programmers. They make use of functions, conditional statements, and variables to create programs that allow a computer to calculate and display a desired output.

### `Functional Programming Language`

Functional programming languages are specially designed to handle symbolic computation and list processing applications. Functional programming is based on mathematical functions. Some of the popular functional programming languages include: Lisp, Python, Erlang, Haskell, Clojure, etc.

Writing a program only in pure functions i.e., never modify variables but
only create new ones as an output.

Used in a situation where we have to perform lots of different
operations on the same set of data like ML.

### `Object Oriented Languages`

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).

NOTE: “One programming language can be of all 3 types like- Python”

### Static vs Dynamic Languages

`Static Type`

- Perform type checking at compile time
- Errors will show at compile time
- Declare datatypes before use
- More control
- Example: Java, C, C++

`Dynamic Type`

- Perform type checking at runtime
- Error might not show till programs run
- No need to declare datatype of
  variables
- Saves time in writing code but might
  give error at runtime.
- Example: Python
