# The Result Enum

the Result enum is defined as having two variants, Ok and Err, as follows:  
```rust
enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}
```

`T` represents the type of the value that will be returned in a success case within the Ok variant, and `E` represents the type of the error that will be returned in a failure case within the Err variant
